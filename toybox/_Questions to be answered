Toy library Questions
==============================

Model
-----

# loan type needs some thought, regarding missing pieces and the issue register
# loan period may not be needed, or set to zero if not fixed?
# Removed member type, a toy can have only one loan type so different member type doesn't make sense
# overdue fine - per week?
# I think this can this be combined with Toy category.
# Is the main difference between the cost of loan the type of toy?

* Do you want rostered days recorded - what will you do with them? - report?

# should there be a borrow register, what about the history of the toy, how popular is it?
# This is a report they are interested in.
# this would be instead of recording the member, due date etc in the toy record. Not sure about state.
