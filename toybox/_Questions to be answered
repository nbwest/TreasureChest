Toy library Questions
==============================

Model
-----

# loan type needs some thought, regarding missing pieces and the issue register
# loan period may not be needed, or set to zero if not fixed?
# Removed member type, a toy can have only one loan type so different member type doesn't make sense
# overdue fine - per week?
# I think this can this be combined with Toy category.
# Is the main difference between the cost of loan the type of toy?

* Do you want rostered days recorded - what will you do with them? - report?

# should there be a borrow register, what about the history of the toy, how popular is it?
# This is a report they are interested in.
# this would be instead of recording the member, due date etc in the toy record. Not sure about state.
- add toy_transaction table, used only for reprting. keep current fields.
toy transaction type
time stamp
member
toy
overdue days/weeks

Transaction:
do we need toy link? no
add balance filed back in


Loan type:
How do you handle increasing toy rent fees?
Loan period is this ever fixed? what is the max?
fines? for missing toy? cost of toy captured in toy
defaults?

Buckets of money? member balance, member membership balance, transactions

Home Page
---------
* What information is useful on the title bar?
* Is daily balance useful?

Borrow Page
----------
* What details of the member should be displayed in the summary?
* Do the members have a balance?
* Should partner name also be searched?
* Max loan duration?
* Default loan duration?
* What details of the toy should be displayed?
* What information is useful in the borrowed toy table?
* Prefer to hide unused sections until they are relevant?
* Due in display days/weeks/date?
* Do you borrow all toys for the same duration?
* How are fees collected/calculated. do you need extra calculations
* overdue fee vs balance? how is balance worked out.
* extra credit given?

* Regarding Borrow use case:
    System calculates fee and volunteer communicates fee to member
    The fee should include the cost to borrow the toys and membership fee and late fees

    The above are different pages - Need rethink on payment form
        Payment to be modal
        Top bar to contain current member being served
        return, borrow to have payment button only
    If borrow and loan over two computers who takes the money?
        All fees go straight into member balance, if balance is low or negative then payment is required
        Either can perform transaction?

* Does anyone ever need change? how would you like to address this?

Internal Discussion
===================
* Done. I think when adding a toy it should be just added and removed if wrong, normal workflow should require two clicks, enter a code then press enter.
* How can we differentiate the newly added toys to the so they can be removed and the fees are included in the total
* Done. Shared and other.py views - break into separate files or bring borrow logic into other.py and rename file?
* Reports page - look into add-ons. Ability to enter in SQL to allow maximum flexibility would be nice
